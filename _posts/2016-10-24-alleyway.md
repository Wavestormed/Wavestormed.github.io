A back alley scene. This was made to demonstrate the level of detail that can be achieved with the Source Engine. Many small details are achieved with decals, such as the
trash on the ground and the graffiti on the walls, as well as the "no trespassing" sign. The 2 most prominent buildings each have individual rooms which can be seen when zoomed
in slightly. This adds that extra bit of realness that many cities in games tend to lack. The blue sky contrasts greatly with the "urban jungle" feel that this scene conveys.
A skybox was used to add extra buildings that end up being much taller than Source's height limit, allowing it to be more convincing.
