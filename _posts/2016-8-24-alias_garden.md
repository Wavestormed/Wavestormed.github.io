The garden area of Alias Gaming's trade map. The idea was to have a cohesive transition from the main trading area into the teleport area. I chose to make it a garden with
a short, rounded wall to show off some of Source's hidden capabilities with architecture. The slight displacements on the ground, small weeds, and puddles give the feeling that
things grow and live, while the flowered bushes give little necessary bursts of color and make it more inviting. I played with several materials for the area and settled on reddish
bricks, as the color is more inviting than cold greys, and contrasts the greenery extremely well.
