An Autumn Scene. This was a strong test of Source's implementation of displacements, as every surface in this scene is a displacement. Autumn is rarely used in games
although from an art standpoint is it beautiful because of its red, brown and orange tones that create a strong, emotional tone. I stuck to the mostly orange color palette
for a general, well-composed tone that keeps consistency throughout. For the composition, it is slightly unbalanced, as the left of the piece is raised, and the right side quickly
drops off. The unbalanced nature of this makes it feel more organic, but also has a strong flow as it moves from left to right. The few green bushes add a pop of color, while the
road winds through the scene, dragging ones eye through the scene. The middle tree is strong and imposing, commanding attention and serves as the anchor of the piece. The piece was split
up into 3 planes to fill the background. The first plane is all individual tree props, the second are 2D images of fall trees that can be more densely packed together, and the final being a
mountain image that is placed in the skybox, to convey depth and give more story to the area. Because of how far away these are placed, they feel natural and it can't immediately be seen
that they are only 2D images.
