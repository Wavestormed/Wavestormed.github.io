The courtyard of Alias Gaming Server's courtyard. This was created as an area for players to choose what areas to warp to, including several mini games and screenshot rooms.
It was designed to evoke the sense of late-century European, which is high-class, symmetrical and generally features plants in the middle. The tree is an excellent focal point,
as it draws vision up to the rest of the building. Several different types of bricks are used to create a sense of unity, but still keeps the same overall texture. They work together,
and play off each other.
