One of the screenshot areas created for Alias Gaming's trade server. For this, the intention was to create a highly detailed, well-lit, colorful environment
where players can take pictures of their weapon skins for advertising purposes. This meant that the lighting had to be positioned extremely carefully, and be behind where players
would spawn, in order to make the player model bright and visible to the player. I wanted to make it feel extremely authentic, and took reference from
several cities in Italy that have extremely bright, colorfully painted buildings. The use of greenery and paver stones, while also keeping  the buildings close together
easily gives the feeling of walking through Italy. The color of the backmost building is bright blue as it immediately commands attention and quickly draws the eye
all the way to the back of the map, forcing one to examine the details as they move their vision back.
