  <p>Hi! My name is Jordan Kegler, my specialty is Game Art, both pixel art and 3D</p>
  <p>I've always had a passion for environment art, whether cartoon or extremely realistic. I always aim to deliver a believable environment that feels that it has been lived in and used</p>
  <p>I also do graphic and logo design, putting a heavy focus on minimalism that not only looks outstanding, but modern. My graphics use a modern, but somewhat hand-drawn feel that are playful and fun</p>
